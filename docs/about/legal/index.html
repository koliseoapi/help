<div class="layman-terms">In which we explain who we are and where we can be found</div>

<p>Extrema Sistemas, S.L., owner of the website <a href="http://koliseo.com">http://koliseo.com</a> (hereinafter Koliseo) residing
at 24A Casas de Miravete St., 28031 Madrid; with CIF B38676615, registered in the Commercial Register

The use or access to Koliseo implies the knowledge and full acceptance of the legal warnings and conditions detailed below. Extrema Sistemas reserves the right to modify these Terms of Use on their own initiative and without prior notice to the User, such requirements entering into force from the time of publication on the web and applied retroactively.</p>

<p>Extrema Sistemas reserves the right to change without prior notice the design, layout and configuration of Koliseo, as well as any existing or new services. Also, Extrema Sistemas reserves the right to, at any time and without notice, deny access to this site to those Users who violate any of these legal conditions or the particular ones that apply to them.</p>

<p>The acceptance of this disclaimer entails the creation of a Legal Agreement with binding effects between Extrema Sistemas and the User. By using Koliseo, the User accepts the User Terms and Conditions (hereinafter the Terms and Conditions) set out below, and agree that the User has the legal capacity to enter and respond by this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<div class="layman-terms">In which we explain that our goal is to sell tickets and promote interaction among users.</div>

<p>Our goal is to provide our Users with the best possible experience in the purchase of tickets for their events. This experience comes along with event management tools and features to share opinions with other Users.</p>

<p>Extrema Sistemas acts as a ticketing agent authorized to sell tickets on behalf of the organizer (hereinafter Organizer) that organizes the event for which the User acquires a ticket. Extrema Sistemas may share with the Organizer personal information of the Users that have purchased tickets. Extrema Sistemas may use data from the User to contact him when necessary, concerning the transactions entered by the User in Koliseo.</p>

<h2 id="user-obligations">User obligations</h2>

<div class="layman-terms">In which the age limit and permitted uses of Koliseo are specified.  It is not allowed to send spam, spread information against morality or reselling tickets. When in doubt, common sense tends to do well.</div>

<h3 id="register-in-the-system">Register in the system</h3>

<p>Koliseo does not store user credentials, and instead delegates in third-party authentication systems. The first time a user logs into Koliseo, the server creates a User Account. The login page clearly states that by logging into the system, the User expresses acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>The minimum age requirement to use Koliseo is 14 years old. The minor children should always ask and get permission from their parents, guardian or legal representative before accessing Koliseo. It is prohibited the access and use to minors that are not authorized. Extrema Sistemas understands that when a minor accesses Koliseo he has the permission of parents, guardian or legal representative. As legal guardian of the children in their care, remember that Koliseo may incorporate information aiming at a diverse audience, and therefore there may be specific areas or sections that include content or comments inappropriate to the minors.</p>

<p>Extrema Sistemas cannot validate the accuracy of data entered and is not responsible for any Users distorting the data. Extrema Sistemas will proceed to block any Users that are found not to meet the minimum legal age or have misrepresented any other data.</p>

<h3 id="personal-information">Personal information</h3>

<p>Koliseo collects personal information (name and e-mail address) required for the normal operation of the site after the first successful sign-in.</p>

<p>When a User registers for an event, they are giving consent to provide their personal data to the organizer of such event, which may not be bound to treat your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Extrema Sistemas is not responsible for the actions of these Organizers with respect to their personal data.</p>

<h3 id="ticket-purchase">Ticket purchase</h3>

<p>In order to make the purchase of tickets, the User declares to be an adult (18 years old or more, depending on applicable law) with the legal capacity to purchase tickets through Koliseo, stating that they accept being bound by this Agreement and understands and accepts all the conditions set forth here for using Koliseo.</p>

<p>The event organizer reserves the right of admission for Users in violation of norms of the venue. In a timely manner, the organizer shall make safety inspections to ensure the safety of customers. Attendees arriving late will be accommodated during a suitable break of the event, but admission will not always be guaranteed in this case. The company is not liable for any lost or stolen tickets.</p>

<h3 id="forbidden-uses">Forbidden uses</h3>

<p>The User agrees to use the services provided by Koliseo in accordance with the Law and these Terms and Conditions, and must refrain from using them to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transmit to unauthorized third parties your username and password.</li>
<li>Upload to the web computer programs capable of causing damage to computer systems belonging to Koliseo, its suppliers or third parties.</li>
<li>Perform illegal activities or contrary to good faith, customs, moral or public order.</li>
<li>Carry out activities in breach of regulations on intellectual and industrial property or other applicable legal standards.</li>
<li>Spread contents that are racist, xenophobic, pornographic, erotic, promoting terrorism or violating human rights.</li>
<li>Harassing another person.</li>
<li>Perform spamming practices and, in general, disseminate unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, &ldquo;junk mail&rdquo;, &ldquo;chain letters&rdquo;, &ldquo;pyramid schemes&rdquo; or any other form of information.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="exclusion-of-liability">Exclusion of Liability</h2>

<div class="layman-terms">In which we clarify that we are going to make mistakes because this system is being developed by humans. However, we keep working hard to make errors memorable as a funny anecdote.</div>

<p>The User acknowledges that it is not technically possible to achieve 100% uptime of Koliseo. Extrema Sistemas does not guarantee the availability and continuity of the service. Extrema Sistemas will not be liable for damages of any kind that may be due to lack of availability or fraudulent use that Users could have made of Koliseo. Extrema Sistemas does not assume any responsibility for any problems accessing the pages of Koliseo. However, Extrema Sistemas will strive to maintain the availability of Koliseo as continuously as possible.</p>

<p>Extrema Sistemas cannot guarantee that files downloaded by the User are free of viruses or malicious files. Extrema Sistemas will not be liable for any damages caused by using Koliseo, including without limitation direct, indirect, incidental, punitive and consequential damages. Extrema Sistemas is not responsible for the products, services, actions or inaction of any venue, artist, producer or third party related to the Web or to which reference has been made.</p>

<h2 id="refunds">Refunds</h2>

<div class="layman-terms">In which the conditions governing the refund of tickets are detailed.</div>

<p>The User must be sure of their intentions before making a purchase because the refund of purchased tickets is not allowed. Failure to attend a performance or a mistake on the purchase of tickets are not valid reasons for a refund. Tickets can only be canceled for technical or operational reasons.</p>

<p>It is important to emphasize that Extrema Sistemas acts as an agent and not as a seller. In the case of event cancellation, the User must get in contact with the Organizer to obtain information about their eligibility for a refund. In case of postponement or rescheduling of the event, the Organizer may establish refund limitations. The maximum amount of a refund will be the nominal value of the entry on the date of acquisition.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the User to know whether an event is canceled or the date and time of any rescheduled event.</p>

<p>Purchased tickets are subject to management fees for ticketing and order processing fees that in no case are refundable. Refunds will be limited to a maximum number of tickets per event to each User.</p>

<h2 id="duration-and-termination">Duration and Termination</h2>

<div class="layman-terms">In which the duration of these legal conditions is measured as well as the right of Extrema Sistemas to remove conflicting contents.</div>

<p>The term of this Legal Agreement is indefinite. Extrema Sistemas may terminate or suspend the availability of any content if it is understood that violates these Terms and Conditions as well as suspend the account of the user responsible.</p>

<p>If any of the clauses mentioned above are invalid or against Law, it will be considered as not included, all the others remaining valid and with full effectiveness for the parties.</p>

<h2 id="applicable-law">Applicable Law</h2>

<div class="layman-terms">We remain reasonable and open to discussion, but in Madrid.</div>

<p>The User agrees that this Agreement is governed by the laws of Spain. The User agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Comunidad de Madrid, Spain for the purpose of litigating all such claims.</p>
