<p>The purpose of the website is to provide our Users with the best possible experience in the purchase of tickets for their events. This experience comes along with event management tools and features to share opinions with other Users.</p>

<h3 id="personal-information">Personal information</h3>
<p>The website collects the personal information necessary to perform our functions. You can read more about <a href="/about/privacy/">our Privacy Policy</a>, including our use of Cookies.</p>
<p>When a User registers for an event, they are giving consent to provide their personal data to the organizer of such event, which may not be bound to treat your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Koliseo is not responsible for the actions of these Organizers with respect to their personal data.</p>
<h3 id="ticket-purchase">Ticket purchase</h3>

<p>The event organizer reserves the right of admission for Users in violation of norms of the venue. In a timely manner, the organizer shall make safety inspections to ensure the safety of customers. Attendees arriving late will be accommodated during a suitable break of the event, but admission will not always be guaranteed in this case. The company is not liable for any lost or stolen tickets.</p>
<h3 id="forbidden-uses">Forbidden uses</h3>
<p>The User agrees to use the services provided by the website in accordance with the Law and these Terms and Conditions, and must refrain from using them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transmit to unauthorized third parties your username and password.</li>
<li>Upload to the web computer programs capable of causing damage to computer systems belonging to the website, its suppliers or third parties.</li>
<li>Perform illegal activities or contrary to good faith, customs, moral or public order.</li>
<li>Carry out activities in breach of regulations on intellectual and industrial property or other applicable legal standards.</li>
<li>Spread contents that are racist, xenophobic, pornographic, erotic, promoting terrorism or violating human rights.</li>
<li>Harassing another person.</li>
<li>Perform spamming practices and, in general, disseminate unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, &ldquo;junk mail&rdquo;, &ldquo;chain letters&rdquo;, &ldquo;pyramid schemes&rdquo; or any other form of information.</li>
<li>Engage in commercial activities without written consent from Koliseo. Swaps, betting, advertising, resale of tickets, etc. will be considered as commercial activities.</li>
<li>The User understands and agrees that without prior notice Koliseo may terminate their access to the website, cancel any tickets or remove any User content that Koliseo believes has violated or is inconsistent with the Terms of Use, or constitutes an infringement of the rights of Koliseo, other Users or the Law.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exclusion-of-liability">Exclusion of Liability</h2>
<p>The User acknowledges that it is not technically possible to achieve 100% uptime of the website. Koliseo does not guarantee the availability and continuity of the service. Koliseo will not be liable for damages of any kind that may be due to lack of availability or fraudulent use that Users could have made of the website. Koliseo does not assume any responsibility for any problems accessing the pages of the website. However, Koliseo will strive to maintain the availability of the website as continuously as possible.</p>
<p>Koliseo cannot guarantee that files downloaded by the User are free of viruses or malicious files. Koliseo will not be liable for any damages caused by using the website, including without limitation direct, indirect, incidental, punitive and consequential damages. Koliseo is not responsible for the products, services, actions or inaction of any venue, artist, producer or third party related to the Web or to which reference has been made.</p>
<h2 id="ticket-refunds">Ticket Refunds</h2>
<p>Failure to attend a performance or a mistake on the purchase of tickets are not valid reasons for a refund. It&rsquo;s up to the event organizer to decide under which conditions a ticket may be refunded. If allowed, the event organizer is the user that must process the refund.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that Koliseo acts as an agent and not as a seller. In the case of event cancellation, the User must get in contact with the Organizer to obtain information about their eligibility for a refund. In case of postponement or rescheduling of the event, the Organizer may establish refund limitations. The maximum amount of a refund will be the nominal value of the entry on the date of acquisition.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the User to know whether an event is canceled or the date and time of any rescheduled event.</p>
<p>Purchased tickets are subject to management fees for ticketing and order processing fees that in no case are refundable (specifically, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/refunds">the fees from the payment processing platform are not returned with a refund</a>). Refunds will be limited to a maximum number of tickets per event to each User.</p>
<h2 id="duration-and-termination">Duration and Termination</h2>
<p>The term of this Legal Agreement is indefinite. Koliseo may terminate or suspend the availability of any content if it is understood that violates these Terms and Conditions as well as suspend the account of the user responsible.</p>
<p>If any of the clauses mentioned above are invalid or against Law, it will be considered as not included, all the others remaining valid and with full effectiveness for the parties.</p>
<h2 id="applicable-law">Applicable Law</h2>
<p>The User agrees that this Agreement is governed by the laws of Spain. The User agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Comunidad de Madrid, Spain for the purpose of litigating all such claims.</p>
