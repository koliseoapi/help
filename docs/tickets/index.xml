      <description>This page introduces the pricing model used by Koliseo.
Our pricing model Koliseo charges a service fee of â‚¬1 + 4% of the ticket price for ticket types that are not free. Free tickets are exempt from this fee: if you do not get income from your event, neither do we. The service fee includes the cost of the payment gateway.
You can choose if you want the ticket buyer or the event organizer to assume the ticket fee.</description>
