This page explains how to configure the list of categories and tags that can be associated with a talk in a Request for proposals. These categories can be used later to filter talks in the agenda.

## Creating categories

As an example, we are going to configure a request for proposals where talks have assigned a "Talk Level" that can choose between "Beginner", "Intermediate" or "Advanced". To do this:

1. Go to the edit page of your event.
2. Select the tab **Request for proposals** and click on your R4P. For instructions about to create your first R4P, [click here]({{< ref "r4p.md" >}}).
3. Select the **Categories** tab and click the **Add Category** button.
4. Introduce "Talk Level" in the **Category** input and "Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced" in the **Allowed values** field.
5. Select **Required** and click the **Save** button.

To test this newly created category, click the **Send your proposal** button to make the page show a talk submission form where you can introduce the **Talk level**.

For categories that may accept multiple choices, mark the **Multiple choice** checkbox while editing the category.

## Using categories in the agenda

In the final agenda there is a form where your users can filter talks by categories.
