This page explains how to create and manage a R4P (Request for Proposals) for your event. To create an agenda with talks, you need to first create a R4P where speakers can submit their talks.

## Creating a Request for Proposals

To create a Request for Proposals:

1. Go to the edit page for your event.
2. Select the **Request for Proposals** tab.
3. Click the **Create R4P** button.
4. Fill out the form and click the **Save** button to create the R4P.

You can introduce the following values in this form:

- **Name**: Name of the R4P. You can have multiple R4P open for the same event.
- **Description**: The description of the R4P with the same Markdown syntax used for [Event descriptions]({{< ref "events/create.md#event-description" >}}).
- **From** and **To**: The date interval where the R4P will be open for submissions.
- **Receive notifications**: Select this checkbox to receive an e-mail with each talk submission.
- **Private R4P**: Select this checkbox to keep the list of proposals hidden until you publish the final agenda. When private is selected, only the author and the selection committee can see the content of each talk.
- **Compensate expenses**: Select this checkbox to ask the speakers if they want to be compensated for travel and lodging expenses.
- **Recording permission**: Select this box to ask your speakers for permission to record their session.

## Get the link to submit talk proposals

After saving the Request for Proposals, you can start accepting talks at the R4P page. To get the link to the page, click the **Get Link** button and then click the button with the clipboard icon.

## Sending a talk proposal

As a speaker, you can submit your talk from the R4P page by clicking the **Send your proposal** button and introducing the **Title** and **Description** of your talk.

Optionally you can introduce your slide deck to help the selection committee understand better the content of your talk. Keep in mind that if your talk is selected, the slides will be visible to others on the agenda page.

You can now add the speaker details and click the **Save** button to save your proposal.

If the Request for Proposals is marked to **Compensate expenses** (see above), you may request travel and lodging expenses for each speaker separately.

If you have something that you want to discuss privately with the organizers, you can use the <b>Comments</b> section. What you introduce here will only be seen by the event organizer, and not by the selection committee or the attendees.

## After the event

Once the event has taken place, both the speakers and event organizer can:

- **Review the feedback** (for events with feedback enabled): As a speaker, you can learn from the feedback to improve your presentations. As the event organizer, you can use the feedback to understand better the interests and expectations of the audience.
- **Add the slide deck and video recording of the talk**. Go to the edit page of the talk and fill out the **Slide deck** and **Video** to see them embedded in the agenda. The **Video** value must be a Youtube URL.
