This page explains how to create and manage a R4P (Request for Proposals) for your event. To create an agenda with talks, you need to first create a R4P where speakers can submit their talks.

## Creating a Request for Proposals

To create a Request for Proposals:

1. Go to the edit page for your event.
2. Select the **Request for Proposals** tab.
3. Click the **Create R4P** button.
4. Fill out the form and click the **Save** button to create the R4P. 

You can introduce the following values in this form:

* **Name**: Name of the R4P. You can have multiple R4P open for the same event.
* **Description**: The description of the R4P with the same Markdown syntax used for [Event descriptions]({{< ref "events/create.md#event-description" >}}).
* **From** and **To**: The date interval where the R4P will be open for submissions.
* **Votes per user** and **Votes per talk**: The number of votes assigned to each member of the [selection committee]({{< ref "talk-selection.md" >}}) and the maximum number of votes that a member can cast for the same talk. 
* **Activate notifications**: select this checkbox to receive an e-mail with each talk submission.
* **Private R4P**: select this checkbox to keep the list of proposals hidden until you publish the final agenda. When private is selected, only the author and the event organizer can see the content of each talk.

After saving the Request for Proposals, you can start accepting talk proposals using the r4p link.

## Sending a talk proposal

As a speaker, you can submit your talk from the R4P page:

1. Click the **Send your proposal** link.
2. Fill the **Title** and **Description** of your talk. 
3. Select the **Speakers** tab, add the speaker details and click the **Save** button to save your proposal.

If you have something that you want to discuss privately with the organizers, you can use the <b>Comments</b> section. Any text introduced here will not be visible by the selection committee, just the event organizer.

## After the event

Once the event has taken place, both the speakers and event organizer can:

* **Review the feedback** (for events with feedback enabled): As a speaker, you can learn from the feedback to improve your presentations. As the event organizer, you can use the feedback to understand better the interests and expectations of the audience.
* **Add the slide deck and video recording of the talk**. Go to the edit page of the talk and fill out the **Slide deck** and **Video** to see them embedded in the agenda. The **Video** value must be a Youtube URL.
