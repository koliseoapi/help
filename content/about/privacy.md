We collect information to provide better services to all of our users. This page explains what information we collect and why we collect it.

## Information that we collect 

We collect information in the following ways:

* **Information you introduce in the platform manually**. For example, you may introduce your Twitter account or a user description in your user profile page.
* **Information we get from your Authentication provider**. When you log into the platform for the first time we get the following information from your authentication provider: **OAuth id**, **Name**, **E-mail address**, and **Photo**. We use this information to identify and contact you in case an event that you are attending or organizing is suffering changes.
* **Logs**. When you use our services, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:
  * The pages that you visited.
  * Your IP address.
  * Some limited information provided by your browser such as browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and referral URL.
* **Local storage**. We may collect and store information locally in your browser using HTML5 technologies to improve the web page performance.
* **Cookies**. We use cookies to store your user session and to aggregate user visits (using Google Analytics) to help us improve our services. Your event organizer may introduce their own Google Analytics information to track visits to their event pages as well. 

You may configure your browser to block cookies from our website or from all websites. However, many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, you will not be able to log in if cookies are not enabled.

## Information we do not have access to

Specifically, we do not get access to this information:

* **Personal information from your OAuth provider other than specified above**. Specifically, we do not have access to your password, list of contacts on social networks, or activity on other websites. During the authentication process Koliseo does not gain permission to do actions on your behalf (other than to retrieve the information detailed above).
* **Credit card information**. When accepting payments, we delegate into a third-party for payment processing. During the whole process Koliseo does not have access to your credit card details.

## Sharing with third parties

We do not share personal information with third parties unless one of the following circumstances applies:

* **With your consent**. Some event organizers may ask to add the information of their attendees to a communications list. In such a case, we require opt-in consent during the ticket purchase process before sharing sensitive personal information.

## Security

We work to protect your data from unauthorized access:

* We encrypt our services using SSL.
* We delegate in third-party providers your user credentials, to provide with a more secure platform.
* We delegate the handling of your credit card details to third-party processing platforms.
* We store our data in one of the most secure Cloud providers, which add extra layers of physical and logical protection.

## Changes

Our Privacy Policy may change. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).
