We collect information to provide a better service to all of our users. This page explains which information we collect and why we collect it.

## Information that we collect

We collect information in the following ways:

- **Information you introduce in the platform manually**. For example, you may enter your Twitter account or a user description on your user profile page.
- **Information we get from your Authentication provider**. When you log into the platform we receive the following information from your authentication provider: **OAuth id**, **Name**, **E-mail address**, and **Photo**. We use this information to identify your user account, and we use your email address for notifications (e.g. when purchasing tickets).
- **Logs**. When you use our services, we automatically collect and store information in server logs, including:
  - The pages that you visited.
  - Your IP address.
  - Some limited information provided by your browser such as browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and referral URL.
- **Local storage**. We may collect and store information locally in your browser using HTML5 technologies to improve the web page performance.
- **Cookies**. We use cookies to store your user session.

If you configure your browser to block cookies from our website, many of our services may not function properly.

## Information we do not have access to

Specifically, we do not get access to this information:

- **Personal information from your OAuth provider other than specified above**. We do not have access to your password, list of contacts on social networks, or activity on other websites. Koliseo does not gain permission to do actions on your behalf, other than to retrieve the information detailed above.
- **Credit card information**. When accepting payments, we delegate the process to a third-party payment processing gateway. During this process, Koliseo does not have access to your credit card details.

## Sharing with third parties

We do not share personal information with third parties unless one of the following circumstances applies:

- **With event organizers**. We only share with event organizers the minimum information to be able to contact you for updates about the event that you will be attending.
- **Anonymized information**. We track cumulative, anonymized statistics about our website. We may share parts of this information with third parties. This information cannot be used to track back to an individual.
- **For legal reasons**. We will share personal information if reasonably necessary to:
  - Meet any applicable law or legal process.
  - Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
  - Protect against harm our users or the public as required or permitted by law.

## Security

We work to protect your data from unauthorized access:

- **We encrypt our services using SSL** and store all our data encrypted.
- **We delegate authentication to secure third-party providers**, so that Koliseo does not have access to your username and password.
- **We delegate the handling of your credit card details to secure, specialized third-party processing platforms**.
- **We store your data in a secure Cloud provider**, which adds extra layers of physical and logical protection.

## Data deletion

If you want us to delete your data, get in contact with info@koliseo.com using the email address associated with your user account.

## Changes

Our Privacy Policy may change. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).
