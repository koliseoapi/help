This page explains how users can provide session feedback from the published agenda. As the organizer, you can use this information to improve the quality of your event.

## Before you start

To receive feedback, you need [a published agenda]({{< ref "agenda.md" >}}) with feedback enabled in the agenda settings. You can see an example [here](https://www.koliseo.com/demo).

## Feedback

Users can provide feedback directly from the published agenda. All feedback (ratings and comments) about a speaker are recorded and publicly available on their user profile.

Feedback provided during the [session review process]({{ ref "review-sessions.md" }}) is only visible to the selection comittee. Feedback provided in the agenda is visible to all users.

## Bookmarks

After logging in, users can bookmark their favorite sessions before the event by clicking the **Bookmark** button. As the organizer, you can later use this information to assign sessions that spark the most interest in tracks with higher capacity.
