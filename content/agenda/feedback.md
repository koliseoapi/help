Users can provide feedback directly from the published agenda. This page explains how to collect this feedback.

## Before you start

To accept feedback, you need <a href="{{< ref "agenda.md#publish" >}}">a published agenda</a> with feedback enabled.

You can see an example [here](https://www.koliseo.com/demo).

## Feedback

Users can provide feedback directly from the published agenda. To make your feedback valuable, the page will warn if the **Comment** field is empty with a rating of 3 or 4 stars, and require a comment if the rating is below that. All feedback about a speaker is recorded and publicly available on their user profile.

## Bookmarks

After logging in, users can bookmark their favorite sessions before the event by clicking the **Bookmark** button. As the organizer, you can later use this information to put the sessions with the most interest in tracks with higher capacity.
