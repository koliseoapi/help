Koliseo supports automatic invoices for your events, where any attendee can create their invoice directly on the platform. This page explains how to use and configure automatic invoices.

## Get the invoice for a ticket

As an attendee, you can create an invoice directly from your ticket page. To do this, once you have purchased the ticket:

1. Open the ticket page. You can do this by following the link in your ticket confirmation e-mail, or by going to your user profile and selecting the **Tickets** tab.
2. Click the **Create invoice** button.
3. Fill all the fields in the form and click the **Save** button to create the invoice.

You can only create an invoice automatically up to 30 days after the event has taken place. Past this date, you would need to contact the event organizer.

## Enabling automatic invoices

To activate automatic invoices, fill out your invoice details:

1. Under the **Events** tab in your dashboard, select your event and click **Edit**. 
2. Select the **Invoices** &raquo; **Invoicing info** tab.
3. Fill out all the fields in the form and click **Save**.

You can specify the concrete type and percentage of taxes according to your local legislation (VAT for the majority of Europe). This configuration may only be applicable for local events where all attendees share the same tax policy. Please consult your legal counsel before enabling automatic invoices, or contact info@koliseo.com if you have questions.
