This page explains how to set up ticket classes available for an event. Each ticket class can have different price, availability dates, visibility and other properties. You can also create [discount codes]({{< ref "discounts.md" >}}) to offer special prices to specific groups of users.

1. {{< login >}}

The following fields are available:

## Availability Settings

You can set the availability of the ticket class in the **Availability** section. The following fields are available:

- **Available by date**: When enabled, you can specify the start and end date of the ticket class availability. Additionally, there is an option to display the availability dates in the purchase page.
- **Available after ticket class**: When enabled, the ticket class will only be available after another ticket class is sold out. You can select the ticket class that needs to be sold out before this ticket class becomes available.
- **Max. tickets per account**: When enabled, you can specify the maximum number of tickets that a single account can buy.

## Paid ticket classes

To sell paid tickets, you need to [connect to your Stripe Account]({{< ref "stripe.md" >}}). The proceedings from your ticket sales go directly to your Stripe Account, after deducing our [service fee]({{< ref "sales.md#ticket-processing-fee" >}}).

Free tickets are exempt from this fee, but keep in mind that they also show a high no-show rate (40-60% is typical).
