This page introduces the pricing model used by Koliseo.

## Our pricing model

Koliseo charges a service fee of **€1 + 4% of the ticket price** for ticket types that are not free. Free tickets are exempt from this fee: if you do not get income from your event, neither do we. The service fee includes the cost of the payment gateway.

As an example, for a ticket price of 10€ the organizer perceives 8.60€.
