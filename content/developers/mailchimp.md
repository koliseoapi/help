This page explains how to integrate Koliseo with Mailchimp. 

## Integrating Mailchimp

Mailchimp is an e-mail marketing service that can be used to send communications to customers. You can register your attendees automatically into your Mailchimp list:

1. Open the edit page of your event.
2. Select the **Features** &raquo; **Plugins** tab.
3. Switch the **Off** button to enable the integration with Mailchimp.
4. In the form, fill in your [Mailchimp API key](https://kb.mailchimp.com/integrations/api-integrations/about-api-keys) and [List ID](https://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/manage-contacts/find-your-list-id), and click the **Save** button.

Bear in mind that the Mailchimp integration includes an opt-in checkbox. Your attendees will have to select a checkbox during the ticket purchase process indicating that they agree to get added to a list on Mailchimp.
