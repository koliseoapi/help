This page explains how to share your event on social networks and enable Google Analytics from your event page.

## Schema.org

The server includes in the event page the HTML tags required by the [Event schema](http://schema.org/Event) to make them indexable by search engines. A similar [Ticket schema](http://schema.org/Ticket) is used in e-mail confirmations so that your smartphone can process and index your tickets.

<aside class="note">
If you are concerned about privacy, you may [mark your event as unlisted]({{<ref "events/create.md">}}) so that it does not show on public search engines.

## Twitter and Facebook

Koliseo also includes with the event page the metadata required by Twitter and Facebook to show the smart card relative to your event. 

## Google Analytics

To track the performance of your event, you can configure your Google Analytics ID. To do this:

1. Log into the system.
2. Go to your user profile by clicking on your picture in the top right corner and selecting your name in the pop-up menu.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Introduce your **Google Analytics ID** and click the **Save** button.

After doing this you can start tracking metrics associated with your events in Google Analytics.
