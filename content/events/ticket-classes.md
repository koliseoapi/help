This page explains how to set up multiple ticket prices and ticket availability periods for an event.

## Adding a Ticket Class

All events start with a single ticket class with a cost of 10€. To modify this:

1. Access your user dashboard and select your event under the **Events** tab.
2. Select the **Date and Time** tab and click on the date where you want to apply a different ticket price.

## Limited availability

To select the dates in which this ticket class will be available, select the **Limited availability** checkbox and enter a date interval. You can leave the start or end date empty.

To make this ticket class visible even when not available, select **Limit visibility** and change the value in the **Type** drop-down to either "Only when the ticket class is available" or "Between specified dates" to specify a date interval.

Limited availability and limited visibility can be combined to hide or make visible your future ticket sale dates.

## Our Fee

Koliseo charges a service fee for paid tickets of [€1 + 4% over the ticket price]({{< ref "pricing.md" >}}).

<aside class="note">
Free tickets are exempt from this service fee, but events with free tickets typically show a high no-show rate (30-60% is typical). Consider assigning a symbolic price of €3-5 to reduce the no-show rate.
