## The ticket processing fee

In addition to our flexible pricing plans, we apply a transparent ticket processing fee for paid events. This ensures the continued development and maintenance of our platform while keeping costs fair and predictable for event organizers.

Koliseo charges a fixed service fee of **4% of the ticket price** (in addition to the Stripe fee) for paid tickets, with a maximum of €25 or $25 for the entire ticket purchase. Note: Free tickets are exempt from this fee.

For example, if you sell a ticket for $100, the service fee would be $4 in addition to the Stripe fee, which is typically around 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (subject to change). If a single ticket purchase includes 10 tickets, the service fee would be capped at $25.
