This page explains how to set up the date and location of an event. 

## Setting the date and location

You can specify multiple dates, locations, and ticket prices for an event:

1. Access your user dashboard and select the event in the **Events** tab. For instructions on how to create your first event, [click here]({{< ref "/events/create.md" >}})
2. Select the **Date and Time** tab.
3. Click the **Add new date** button.
4. Introduce a **Date**, **Time** and **Location** for the event.
5. Click the **Save** button to add this date to the event.

<aside class="note">You should be able to introduce directly the name of the venue as a location to get the address automatically resolved.</aside>

To specify a different time zone or for events that span over multiple dates, click on **Advanced view**. 

Once created, the new date should be visible in the list under the **Date and Time** tab. To see past dates in this list, select the **Display past dates** checkbox.
