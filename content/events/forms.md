This page explains how to configure attendee forms. Forms can be used to collect information about the person purchasing the ticket, like T-shirt size or role in the company. 

## Defining a form

As the event organizer, you can define a form that attendees must fill out to get their tickets. For example, to request the role in the company:

1. Go to the edit page of your event.
2. Select the **Features** &raquo; **Form** tab.
3. Click the **Add field** button.
4. Introduce "Role in your organization" into the **Field name** input.
5. Select "text" into the **Type** drop-down.
6. Select **Required**.
7. Add other fields as needed. When you are done, click **Save**

Koliseo supports the following field types: 

* **Text** and **Text Area** for single-line or multiline free text.
* **Select** to choose from a comma-separated range of values.
* **Number** for an integer number greater or equal to zero.
* **Telephone**.
* **Date**.
* **E-mail**. 
* **Checkbox**. 

You can sort or delete fields using the buttons below each field. To save your changes, click the **Save** button at the top of the page.

## Filling out the form

When an event includes a form, the ticket purchase page displays a set of input fields for each attendee. The attendees must fill out all fields marked as required to get their tickets. 

## Collecting the form input

To get the list of form values introduced by attendees, [download the list of tickets]({{< ref "validation.md#list-of-tickets" >}}) and open the downloaded file with a spreadsheet application. The values are in the columns to the right of the spreadsheet.
