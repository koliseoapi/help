This page explains how to make tickets available (free or not) for your event.

## Enabling ticket sales

Once your event is ready, activate ticket sales to let users attend the event. To get started:

1. Go to your user dashboard.
2. Select the **Events** tab and click on the event. For instructions to create your first event, [click here]({{< ref "/events/create.md" >}}).
3. Select the **Actions** tab.
4. Click on the **Resume selling** button.

To pause the ticket sales, click again on the **Stop selling** button.

## Share the link to get tickets

To copy the link to purchase tickets for your event, click the **Get Link** button and then click the button with the clipboard icon. You can later share the link using e-mail or your social networks.

Koliseo delegates payment processing on [Stripe](http://stripe.com), a secure online payment gateway. For security reasons, Koliseo does not have access to the credit card details associated with your ticket purchase.

Starting in July 2019, Koliseo requires that all purchases follow the [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) guidelines, which may require 3D Secure validation from your banking website.

## Receiving the payment from ticket sales

We transfer the funds collected from your ticket sales one week after the event has taken place, and for this we need that you introduce your wire transfer information:

1. [Log into the system]({{< ref "authentication.md" >}}).
2. Click on your picture in the top right corner of the screen and select the menu option with your name.
3. Select the **Payment info** tab.
4. Fill out the form with your payment details (**IBAN**, **VAT ID**, **Billing name** and **Billing address**) and click the **Save** button.

Our accounting team will get in contact to transfer the funds (after subtracting our fee) to this IBAN account and send you our invoice via e-mail.

Ticket refunds using the platform are not possible after this transfer has completed.
