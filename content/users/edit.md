This page explains how to edit your user profile.

## Edit your user profile

To edit your user profile:

1. Visit your user profile page by clicking on your name in the top right corner of the screen and selecting **My Profile**, or alternatively by following [this link](https://koliseo.com/me).
2. On the sidebar menu, select **Edit**.
3. Introduce your changes in the form and click the **Save** button.

The following fields are available:

- **Name**: Your full name.
- **Avatar**: Your profile photo, used to identify you in the platform. To change your avatar, click the **Edit** button next to your picture. Koliseo extracts your profile picture from your authentication provider when you log in for the first time, and with every new session it will update it if needed. When you upload a custom picture, this behavior will be disabled.
- **Username**: The unique identifier of your user profile in the platform. It is used to generate the URL of your profile page. You can change it at any time, but if you do, the old URL will stop working. If you want to change it, we recommend you to do it as soon as possible.
- **Description**: A short (140 characters) description to display on your user profile.
- **Twitter account**: If set, your Twitter handle will be visible in your user profile and in any sessions where you are a speaker.
- **Language**: The language you prefer to use in the platform. This language will be used to display the platform interface, and to send you e-mails. You can change it at any time. By default Koliseo will use the language provided by your browser and save it into your user account the first time you log in.

You may override the language used by any page at any time by adding a `hl=en` or `hl=es` GET parameter to your URL.

## User deletion

To delete your user information, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@koliseo.com">info@koliseo.com</a> and we will proceed to remove your data.

After deleting your user account:

- We will remove your sessions, feedback or bookmarks. Any session that belong to an agenda will remain, but the presenter information will be removed.
- We will reassign any existing tickets or events with sold tickets to a different user. We will keep them for accounting purposes.

## Merge user accounts

If you have used different authentication providers to log in to Koliseo, you may have ended up with multiple user accounts. If you log in with an account using the same e-mail address as an existing user, Koliseo will automatically merge the accounts.

To help avoid confusion, the login page shows which provider you used the last time.
