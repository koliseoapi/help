This page explains the authentication process in Koliseo.

## Authentication providers

Koliseo supports Google, Facebook and Microsoft users to authenticate into the platform. If it's your first time logging in, you need to accept our [terms and conditions]({{< ref "legal.md" >}}) (including our use of Cookies) before the system creates an account in Koliseo with your user information.

During the authentication process Koliseo will get access to the following information about your user profile:

- **OAuth ID**: A unique identifier for your user account from your selected OAuth provider.
- **User Name**: Your full name.
- **E-mail address**: Your e-mail address, used to send you notifications about your events.
- **Photo**: Your profile photo, used to identify you in the platform.

Koliseo will not get access to your password, contacts or get permissions to do actions on your behalf.

## Custom usernames and passwords

Koliseo does not support the creation of custom usernames and passwords. We delegate user authentication to trusted third-party OAuth providers because we believe this is a more secure alternative for managing user credentials. To use the platform, you need an account with one of these providers.
