This page explains how the authentication and user management system works in Koliseo. 

## Authentication providers

Koliseo supports four providers to authenticate users into the platform: Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Linkedin. The server will create your user account automatically the first time that you log in. By logging into the platform you agree to our [terms and conditions](https://www.koliseo.com/legal), including our use of Cookies.

During the authentication process Koliseo will get access to the following information about your user profile:

* OAuth id
* Name
* E-mail
* Photo

Koliseo will not get access to your contacts or get permissions to do actions on your behalf. 

## Custom usernames and passwords

Koliseo does not support the creation of custom usernames and passwords. We delegate user authentication into third-party OAuth providers because we believe it's the most secure option for managing user credentials. To use the platform, you need an account with one of these providers.
