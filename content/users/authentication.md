This page explains the authentication process in Koliseo.

## Authentication providers

Koliseo supports four OAuth providers to authenticate users into the platform: Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter / X. If it's your first time logging in, the system will create your user account automatically after accepting our [terms and conditions]({{< ref "legal.md" >}}), including our use of Cookies.

During the authentication process Koliseo will get access to the following information about your user profile:

- **OAuth ID**: A unique identifier for your user account from your selected OAuth provider.
- **User Name**: Your full name.
- **E-mail address**: Your e-mail address, used to send you notifications about your events.
- **Photo**: Your profile photo, used to identify you in the platform.

Koliseo will not get access to your password, contacts or get permissions to do actions on your behalf.

## Custom usernames and passwords

Koliseo does not support the creation of custom usernames and passwords. We delegate user authentication to trusted third-party OAuth providers because we believe this is a more secure alternative for managing user credentials. To use the platform, you need an account with one of these providers.
