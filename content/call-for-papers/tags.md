This page explains how to configure the list of categories and tags that the speakers can associate with their sessions in a Call for Papers. These categories can be used later to filter sessions in the agenda.

## Creating tags

As an example, we are going to configure a Call for Papers where sessions have assigned a "Talk Level" that can choose between "Beginner", "Intermediate" or "Advanced". To do this:

1. Go to the edit page of your event.
2. Select the tab **Call for Papers** and click on your Call for Papers. For instructions about to create your first Call for Papers, [click here]({{< ref "call-for-papers.md" >}}).
3. Select the **Categories** tab and click the **Add Category** button.
4. Introduce "Talk Level" in the **Category** input and "Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced" in the **Allowed values** field.
5. Select **Required** and click the **Save** button.

2To test this newly created category, click the **Send your proposal** button to make the page show a talk submission form where you can introduce the **Talk level**.

For categories that may accept multiple choices, mark the **Multiple choice** checkbox while editing the category.

## Filtering using categories

Other users can filter sessions by categories using the form at the top of the talk submission page or the published agenda.
